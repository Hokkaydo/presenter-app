[![Generated APK AAB (Upload - Create Artefact To Github Action)](https://github.com/Hokkaydo/presenter-app/actions/workflows/android-build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Hokkaydo/presenter-app/actions/workflows/android-build.yml)
# Presenter APK
This application is intended to be used with [presenterd](https://github.com/Hokkaydo/presenterd).

Once run and connected to the daemon through Bluetooth LE (Low-Energy), it allows sending commands using volume keys, even when the phone is locked.

The intended use case is to allow switching the slides during a presentation by discreetly pressing a button on the device. 
The `Volume Down` button sends a `Left` keystroke, switching to the previous slide, while the `Volume Up` button sends a `Right` keystroke, switching to the next slide.

For installation, see the `Release APK` produced by the last [Action](https://github.com/Hokkaydo/presenter-app/actions).

More detailed instructions will follow later.
